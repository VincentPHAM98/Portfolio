          After my internship, I fully integrated the studio in the same role, where I worked on new features to add to the engine.
          The work flow stayed the same but this time I was more autonomous as my tasks required me to communicate with other teams in the studio to satisfy their needs.
          I will again share a non-exhaustive list of tasks I worked on as I can not share much details due to confidentiality clause :
          Physically based rendering research and development, particle system enhancements, environment values system and transition...

        <p>
          In April 2022 I joined Wild Sheep Studio, a AA independent game studio based in Montpellier as a graphics programmer for my end of studies internship.
          The goal was to implement a rendering technique to visually enhance the quality of shadows on small details.
          The process of development was composed of numerous steps which I will share in a non-exhaustive list : state of the art research, documentation, kick-off meeting
          , prototyping, development iterations, debugging, optimisation, tooling, code reviews...
